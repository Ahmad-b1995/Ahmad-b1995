- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Ahmad-b1995
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in front-end development and new technologies.
-   I use Angular as my primary front-end development framework.
-   I also love and recommend arch linux for every fan of simplicity and free-bloat software and operating system.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently improving my javascript skills and working to have a deeper understanding for creating clever and problem-solving algorithms.
